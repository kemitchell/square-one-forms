## 34 :1B-265  Employee rights to certain inventions.

1\. a.  (1) Any provision in an employment contract between an employee and employer, which provides that the employee shall assign or offer to assign any of the employee's rights to an invention to that employer, shall not apply to an invention that the employee develops entirely on the employee's own time, and without using the employer's equipment, supplies, facilities or information, including any trade secret information, except for those inventions that:

(a)   relate to the employer's business or actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development; or

(b)   result from any work performed by the employee on behalf of the employer.

(2)   To the extent any provision in an employment contract applies, or intends to apply, to an employee invention subject to this subsection, the provision shall be deemed against the public policy of this State and shall be unenforceable.

b.   No employer shall require a provision made void and unenforceable by this act as a condition of employment or continued employment.  Nothing in this act shall be construed to forbid or restrict the right of an employer to provide in contracts of employment for:

(1)   disclosure, provided that any disclosure shall be received in confidence, of all of an employee's inventions made solely or jointly with others during the term of the employee's employment;

(2)   a review process by the employer to determine any issues that may arise; and

(3)   full title to certain patents and inventions to be in the United States, as required by contracts between the employer and the United States or any of its agencies.

c.  Nothing in this act shall be deemed to impede or otherwise diminish the rights of alienation of inventors or patent-owners.
