# Work

You will do the work described in the statement of work incorporating these terms by reference. The company will pay the fees described in the statement of work, and reimburse expenses that an executive officer of the company approves in writing, specifically, in advance. You will bill the company for fees and expenses as described in the statement of work.

# Payment

## Deadline

The company will pay each correctly billed amount within `payment deadline` of receiving the bill.

## Errors

The company will notify you by e-mail of any suspected error in a bill within `billing error notice deadline` of receiving the bill. If the company does not notify of an error in that time, the company will pay the billed amount.

## Late Payments

The company will pay you `late payment interest` interest on late bill payments, compounded monthly. If the law sets a lower maximum rate of late-payment interest, the company will pay that rate instead.

## Stopping Work

If the company does not pay a bill on time, you may notify the company by e-mail and stop work until all bills are paid. Stopping work in this way postpones all deadlines under this agreement for as long as work stops. Any recurring fees continue to add up.

## Cost of Collection

If the company does not pay a bill on time, the company agrees to pay your costs of pursuing payment and collecting that bill, such as attorney fees and costs, that your incur after the deadline for payment.

# Term

## Expiration

This agreement will end once work is done under the statement of work.

## Early Termination

You or the company can end this agreement early by notifying the other by e-mail `early termination deadline` in advance. The company can also end this agreement early under [Conflicts](#conflicts).

## Final Bill

When this agreement ends, you will stop work and bill the company for work already done.

## Continuing Provisions

These sections continue to apply after this agreement ends: [Work](#work), [Payment](#payment), [Working Relationship](#working-relationship), and [Limit on Liability](#limit-on-liability).

# Working Relationship

## Independence

You will decide when, where, and how to work under this agreement, with the discretion of an independent contractor. You will not have any power to enter agreements or take other legal action on the company's behalf.

## Personnel

Unless the statement of work says otherwise, you may use employee and contractor personnel to do any work under this agreement. Those personnel will be your employees and contractors, not the company's.

## No Benefits

Neither you nor any of your personnel will receive any employee benefits from the company.

## Compliance

You and the company agree to do your respective parts for tax, labor, employment, and immigration law compliance, consistent with an independent-contractor relationship under this agreement.

## Compliance Indemnity

You will pay any losses that the company pays or becomes legally responsible to pay, including expenses of defending against any legal claim related to your failure under [Compliance](#compliance) for you or any of your personnel. The company will promptly notify you by e-mail whenever it anticipates possible losses that you might have to pay. If the company fails to notify you promptly, you will not pay the company losses that you could have reduced or defended against if the company had notified you promptly.

## Conflicts

You will notify the company by e-mail of any other company that you anticipate working with that the company could reasonably see as a direct competitor. In response, the company may end this agreement, effective immediately, by notifying you by e-mail.
