# At Will

Your offer is for "at will" employment.  The company can let you go at any time, for any reason, without advance warning.  By the same token, you can leave the company at any time, for any reason, by notifying the company in writing.

# Eligibility

You must give your hiring contact documents to prove that you have the right to work in the United States, such as ID and a social security card, a passport, or a green card, within three days of starting work.  This requirement applies to United States citizens and others alike.

# Conflicts

By accepting your offer, you guarantee that you aren't under any contract or other legal obligation that will prevent you from doing your job.

# Commitment

If your offer is for full-time employment, you agree to devote your whole normal working time to the company.

# Confidentiality and Intellectual Property

In order to become an employee, you must first agree to terms with the company about confidentiality and intellectual property.  You agree to the Square One Standard Confidentiality and Intellectual Property Terms, First Edition, Second Correction (https://squareoneforms.com/confidentiality-ip/1e2c).

# Policies

During your work for the company, you will abide by company policies, handbooks, and other rules that apply to employees in positions similar to yours.

# Hours

- If your offer includes a salary, you will work during the company's regular business hours at your work location.  If you count as an "exempt employee" under the law, you will also work any other hours needed to complete your assignments.

- If your offer includes an hourly rate of pay, you will work the hours assigned to you by your supervisor.  Your supervisor may change your hours over time.

# Pay

The pay on your offer letter will be your initial rate of pay.  The company may adjust your pay from time to time according to its compensation policies.

# Payroll

The company will pay you on its normal payroll schedule.

# Tax

The pay and other compensation the company offers you may be subject to withholding, payroll taxes, and other deductions required by law.  The company encourages you to discuss tax strategies with a tax accountant or tax lawyer.  However, the company doesn't promise to design or pay your compensation in ways that minimize your tax.

# Equity

If your offer letter includes equity compensation like stock, options, or appreciation rights, that compensation is subject to approval by the company's board of directors or other governing body.

# Benefits

You will be eligible to participate in company benefits programs for employees in positions similar to yours.

# Vacation

You will be eligible for paid vacation under the company's vacation policy.

# Governing Law

The law of the state of the work location on your offer letter will govern all rights and duties under these terms.

# Changes

You and the company will change the terms of your employment, if ever, only by writing the changes down and cosigning them.

# All Terms

These terms, the offer letter referencing them, and the required confidentiality and intellectual property agreement set out all the terms for your offer of employment by the company.  They replace any other terms about your employment you may have been discussed before, in conversation or in writing.
