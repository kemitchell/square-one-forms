# Overview

These terms set out the rules about confidential information and intellectual property for your work for the company.  If the company employs you, these terms apply to your work as an employee.  If the company hires you as a contractor, these terms apply to your work as a contractor.

# Confidentiality

## Purpose of Confidentiality

The purpose of [Confidentiality](#confidentiality) is to protect company secrets and meet the company's obligations under confidentiality agreements with customers, suppliers, and others.

## Confidential Information

With the exceptions listed in [Not Confidential Information](#not-confidential-information), **Confidential Information** means:

- information the company shares with or makes available to you during your work for the company

- information you develop during your work for the company

- information the company shared with you before you started work with the company

- information building on these kinds of information

## Not Confidential Information

### Public Information

Information that is already public is not _Confidential Information_.  _Confidential Information_ that becomes public stops being _Confidential Information_, unless you made it public in breach of these terms.

### Information from Other Sources

Information that you have or get access to unrelated to your work for the company is not _Confidential Information_, unless the source breached a confidentiality obligation to the company by providing the information to you.

### Independently Developed Information

Information you develop or discover on your own, unrelated to your work for the company and without using company resources, is not, or stops being, _Confidential Information_.

### General Knowledge, Skills, and Experience

General knowledge, skills, and experience you need to practice your profession or work in your field is not _Confidential Information_.  [Confidentiality](#condifentiality) is not intended to keep you from working, or even fairly competing with the company, after your work with the company ends.

## Nondisclosure

Except as required by law, you agree not to disclose any _Confidential Information_ to anyone, except as directed, in writing, by an officer of the company.

## Limited Use

You agree to use _Confidential Information_ only in your work for the company, to benefit the company.

## Security

You agree to take reasonable measures to secure computer files, documents, e-mails, and any other materials containing _Confidential Information_.  If the company provides written security requirements for some or all _Confidential Information_ you receive, you agree to follow those requirements to the best of your ability, and to tell your supervisor immediately about requirements you can't follow.

## Preserve Proprietary Notices

You agree not to remove any copyright notices, confidential markings, or other proprietary notices from materials containing _Confidential Information_.

## Legally Required Disclosure

These rules apply when the law requires you to disclose _Confidential Information_, or when you reasonably suspect the law may require you to:

### Give Notice of Required Disclosure

If the law allows, you agree to promptly notify the company of the nature of the requirement and the _Confidential Information_ affected.  If practical, you agree to give notice quickly enough to give the company a practical chance to start a proceeding to protect the confidentiality of the _Confidential Information_.

### Cooperate and Assist

On company request, you agree to cooperate with the company and provide reasonable assistance to the company in any proceeding to protect the confidentiality of _Confidential Information_.  The company agrees to reimburse your reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of that cooperation and assistance.

## Give Notice of Leaks

You agree to tell the company in writing whenever you become aware, suspect, or anticipate that _Confidential Information_ has been or will be disclosed or used in breach of this agreement or other confidentiality agreements with the company.

## Return and Destruction

When your work with the company ends, and whenever the company asks you to in writing:

- You agree to promptly return any physical materials containing _Confidential Information_ that the company asks for.

- You agree to promptly destroy all other materials containing _Confidential Information_

## After Termination

After your work with the company ends:

- Your obligations for _Confidential Information_ that you know or should reasonably expect the company protects as a trade secret continue as long as the _Confidential Information_ remains a trade secret.

- Your obligations for other _Confidential Information_ continue for five calendar years from the date your work with the company ended.

## Defend Trade Secrets Act Notice

Per the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016:

- An individual shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any Federal or State trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that:

  - is made:

    - in confidence to a Federal, State, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney; and

    - solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or

  - is made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal.

- An individual who files a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer for reporting a suspected violation of law may disclose the trade secret to the attorney of the individual and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding, if the individual:

  - files any document containing the trade secret under seal; and

  - does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order.

# Intellectual Property

## Intellectual Property Rights

**Intellectual Property Rights** are legal rights in ideas, inventions, information, and other things that aren't physical property.  Copyrights, patents, trade secrets, and trademarks are the most common.  When these terms say _Intellectual Property Rights_, they also mean legal rights in applications to protect _Intellectual Property Rights_, like copyright, trademark, and patent applications.

## Purpose of Intellectual Property Terms

The purpose of [Intellectual Property](#intellectual-property) is to make sure the company gets ownership of all _Intellectual Property Rights_ in your work for the company, or, failing that, broad licenses for it.  In summary:

- You promise to let the company know about the work you do in [Disclosure](#disclosure).

- If the law allows the company to own copyright in your work from the start, [Work Made for Hire](#work-made-for-hire) makes it so.

- If rights in your work unavoidably belong to you to start, you transfer them to the company in [Assignment](#assignment).

- If you can't transfer your rights, or use the rights of others, you license them to the company in [License](#license).

- If you can't transfer special "moral rights", such as in artwork, you agree not to enforce those rights in [Moral Rights](#moral-rights).

## Covered Intellectual Property

### General Definition

**New Intellectual Property** means all _Intellectual Property Rights_ in these kinds of work, created by you alone or with others:

  - work you did before starting work with the company, as a head start on work for the company

  - work you do for the company

  - work you create using equipment, supplies, facilities, or confidential information from the company

  - any work building on these kinds of work

### State Law Exclusions

If you work in a state with laws that limit the _Intellectual Property Rights_ that terms like these can assign to the company, _New Intellectual Property_ does not include any rights that can't legally be assigned under that law. Examples of those state laws include:

- California Labor Code section 2870
- Delaware Code title 19 section 805
- Illinois Compiled Statutes section 1060/2
- Kansas Labor and Industries Code section 44-130
- Minnesota Labor, Industry Code section 181.78
- New Jersey Statutes section 34:1B-265
- North Carolina General Statutes chapter 66 article 10 sections 66-57.1 and 66-57.2
- Utah Code title 34 chapter 39
- Washington Revised Code sections 49.44.140 and 49.44.150

## Disclosure

You agree to keep records of the work you create for the company, and to promptly disclose _New Intellectual Property_ covered by these terms to the company in writing, as it is created.  If you're not sure whether you've created _New Intellectual Property_, you agree to disclose your work to the company anyway, so the company can decide.

## Work Made for Hire

### Express Agreement to Make "Work Made for Hire"

Subject to [State Employment Law Exception](#state-employment-law-exception), as far as the law allows, _New Intellectual Property_ will be "work made for hire" under copyright law.

### State Employment Law Exception

Some states have laws that make workers who agree to make "work made for hire" into employees, even if they would otherwise be contractors.  For example, section 3351.5(c) of the California Labor Code and section 686 of the California Unemployment Insurance Code.  If you work in one of those states and work for the company as a contractor, [Express Agreement to Make "Work Made for Hire"](#express-agreement-to-make-work-made-for-hire) does not apply if it would make you an employee under that state's law.

## Assignment

### Assignment of Rights

You assign all your rights in _New Intellectual Property_ that aren't covered by [Work Made for Hire](#work-made-for-hire) to the company.

### Further Steps

You agree to do everything necessary to paper assignments in [Assignment](#assignment), make them legally effective, and help the company enforce the rights assigned.  The company will notify you by e-mail of any further steps required, provide all necessary documentation, and reimburse you for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.

### Acting on Your Behalf

#### What the Company Can Do

The company can take action under [Further Steps](#further-steps) on your behalf if you aren't capable of doing so, if you refuse to do so, of if the company can't find you or get in touch with you.

#### Legal Intent

In legal terms of art, [What the Company Can Do](#what-the-company-can-do) appoints the company as your "attorney in fact with full right of substitution" to act on your behalf under [Further Steps](#further-steps).

## License

You give the company a license for all rights in _New Intellectual Property_ that aren't covered by [Work Made for Hire](#work-made-for-hire) or [Assignment](#assignment), as well as any _Intellectual Property Rights_ of others that you use in work for the company.  That license allows the company to do anything that would otherwise infringe _Intellectual Property Rights_, and to sublicense others to do so.  The license isn't limited in time or otherwise, and you can't revoke it.

## Moral Rights

If the law gives you "moral rights" in work for the company that you can't assign, you waive those rights and promise not to enforce them against anyone.

# Responsibilities

## Conflicting Agreements

You guarantee that agreeing to these terms and following them won't cause you to break any other agreement with anyone else

## Intellectual Property Infringement

You guarantee you will not infringe the _Intellectual Property Rights_ of others in work for the company

## Open Licensing

If the company provides policies on acceptable terms for open source, open data, open content, material dedicated to the public domain, or similar kinds of freely available work, you agree to follow those policies.  You guarantee that any freely available work that you include in or build on in _New Intellectual Property_ will conform to those policies.

## Rights to License

Otherwise, you guarantee that you will not include or build on material covered by _Intellectual Property Rights_ that you can't license to the company under [License](#license) in work for the company.

# General Contract Terms

## Law

If the company employs you, the law of the state where you work will govern all rights and duties under these terms.  If the company hires you as a contractor, the same law that governs your contract governs these terms.

## Disputes

If the company employs you, the company agrees to make any legal claims related to these terms only in the federal or state courts nearest the address that the company provides with its signature.  If the company hires you as a contractor, the company agrees to follow the dispute-resolution terms of your contract for legal claims related to these terms.

## Whole Agreement

These terms and any document incorporating them by reference list all the terms you and the company agree to about confidentiality and intellectual property in your work for the company.

## No Assignment

You may not assign this agreement without written permission from the company.  The company can assign this agreement, as a whole, to another business entity that acquires its stock or substantially all its assets, or to a new business entity set up to change its legal form or jurisdiction.  Any attempt to assign rights under this agreement against these terms has no legal effect.

## No Delegation

Neither side may delegate any duty under this agreement.  Any attempt to delegate has no legal effect.

## Unenforceable Terms

If a court decides that any part of these terms can't be enforced, for any reason, the rest of these terms will continue to apply.
